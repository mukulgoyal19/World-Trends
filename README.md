## About The Project
### Introduction
The Dataset of Diamonds clarity and pricing has been taken for visualization such that the mispriced diamonds can be observed.
The Aim for creating this Visualization was to study the quality vs pricing insights using Visualizd graphs and to answer :
* Does the relationship between price and clarity always hold true. (Looking at statatical average for clarity).
* Does a better clarity always mean the diamond is priced higher or Does the relationship sometimes hold true, or are they mispriced in market.

### Insights
![Clarity Vs Pricing](https://github.com/mukulgoyal19/MisPriced-Diamonds/blob/master/Mispriced%20-%20Diamonds.png)

* **Comparisons**
  * **Best (Quality Vs Pricing)**: "IF" Category, good quality are priced higher and low or faulty diamonds are priced lower.
  * **Worst (Quality Vs Pricing)**: "I1" Category, Good quality are priced lower.
* Some Lines are crossing at higher ends and at lower ends, so they are mispriced.
